To combine data W+ and W- results to W Inclusive data run:
root -l CombineChargeToIncl_Ele(Mu).C


To combine Theory(ResBos,FEWZ) W+ and W- results to W Inclusive run:
python combineTheory.py

To get the plot where we compare Inclusive W Electron and Muon channel results with Resbos run:
python theoryCompChannel.py



To get the Inclsuive W cross section plots and Theory-Data comparison(ResBos, Powheg, FEWZ) plots run:
python theoryStudy_separate.py
